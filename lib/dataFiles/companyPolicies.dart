String aboutus = """
Every story starts with a change. The story of Sweet Raga starts with the conception of an idea that was born from nostalgia and love for food. Ever since the modernization of the food industry, Indian food has evolved immensely. A fusion of traditional and foreign tastes, style and presentation is a common occurrence now. The only things that remained unchanged were our confections.

The popularity and consumption of Indian sweets have seen a steady diminution in the past few years. With the onset of healthy living and different kinds of diet, people have become hesitant to consume traditional Indian sweet treats. This repugnance towards our authentic sweets troubled one man. This man was Chef Abhishek Rajan, and he set out to bring the glory back to our Mithais.

Through years of culinary experience and thorough study of trends, he concluded that the problem lies in the compromised quality and trifling nutritional value of the Indian sweets served these days. Usage of subpar raw materials, high sugar content, synthetic ghee and the like pose a very high risk of foodborne illnesses. Moreover, with the availability of western desserts with exotic flavors and alluring display a direct option is created against the traditional Mithais. Thus a third viable option needed to be created.

At this stage, Sweet Raga was born. Sweet raga is a project designed under the company 3CS (Cooks Cruise Catering Solutions) which primarily provides consultation regarding food business. Here at Sweet Raga, we have created traditional Indian Mithais in a new avatar with carefully sourced premium ingredients. Our treats are a perfect combination of exceptional taste, nourishment, quality, and design.

We welcome you to experience and relish the uniqueness of Indian Mithais crafted by sweet raga.
